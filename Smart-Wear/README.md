# SmartWear - A Clothing Rental Website

Using Laravel as the framework, this project delivers an e-commerce rental websiteâ€”a smart way to rent clothes for users and vendor businesses.  
It was a project for System Design Course CSE471. Along with me, two more people <span style="color:blue;">Shihab Muhtasim and Nusaiba Alam</span> worked on this project.
